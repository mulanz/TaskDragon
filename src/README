Instructions to TaskDragon: 
-The goal of TaskDragon is to complete Habits and Todos to grow a dragon. To add a habit or task, click the (+) 
buttons in the two lists. 
-When it asks you for a new task, don't forget to name your habits and todos!!!! If you don't, it won't work! 
-When you finish a task, click the checkbox and the tasks will disappear. Todos will increase your dragon's age
by 5. When your dragon is 20, it will evolve. The picture will change, because your dragon grew. The program
will inform you! 
-There is a database, so when you exit out of the file and rerun it, it will remember the tasks you haven't finished,
and your dragon stats. 
-Have fun!
